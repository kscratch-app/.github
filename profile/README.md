### About kScratch

kScratch is a modern, cross-platform desktop client for managing Kubernetes clusters, built with Rust and SolidJS for maximum performance and a lightweight footprint. It's designed for DevOps, SREs, and developers who need a powerful tool to visualize, debug, and manage multiple clusters without the overhead of web-based or Electron applications.
